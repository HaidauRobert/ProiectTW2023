                <p>
                    The scope of the software is enabling people to find common grounds in things they hate, thus bringing them together in a "enemy of my enemy" kind of fashion.
                    Is may also become useful as a psychology study if enough people start using it.
                    The application does not aim to make any profit whatsoever, the main and only goal being passing the "Web Technologies" subject.
