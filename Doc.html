                <p>
                    The scope of the software is enabling people to find common grounds in things they hate, thus bringing them together in a "enemy of my enemy" kind of fashion.
                    Is may also become useful as a psychology study if enough people start using it.
                    The application does not aim to make any profit whatsoever, the main and only goal being passing the "Web Technologies" subject.

                    A Security hazard prezent in the application is loss of anonimity, thus giving unknown third parties access to a link between the real person and their private data.
                    The application should be used only with HTTPS to this end. 
                    The digital certificate needs to be renewed from time to time.
